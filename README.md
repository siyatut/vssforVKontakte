# Test task for VK.
This application was developed as a test task for VKontakte. It calculates the spread of the virus.

Technical requirements were : 
1. Recalculation of the number of “sick” elements shouldn't be executed in the application UI thread. 
2. The application interface must be responsive at any time: the screen must respond when elements are clicked (infection of “healthy” elements at the user’s initiative must be taken into account as soon as possible, even if the new screen state is currently being recalculated). 
3. The dimensions of the elements must comply with the Human Interface Guidelines so that the user can easily interact with the elements. 
4. Programming language: Objective-C or Swift.
